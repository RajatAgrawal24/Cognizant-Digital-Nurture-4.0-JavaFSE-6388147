1. Why Data Structures and Algorithms Are Important:

    Efficient data structures allow fast access, insertion, and deletion of inventory items.

    Algorithms help manage inventory with minimum processing time, even when the data grows large.

    For instance, if you have 10,000+ products, you need fast lookup by productId.


2. Suitable Data Structures:

    ArrayList:

        Stores items in order.

        Slower for search, update, and delete by ID (linear time).

    HashMap (Map<Integer, Product>):

        Key = productId, Value = Product

        Offers O(1) time for add, update, delete, and search.


3. Time Complexity

    Add Product           O(1)
    Update Product        O(1)
    Delete Product        O(1)
    Display Inventory     O(n)


4. Optimizations

    Use HashMap with productId as key for fast access.

    If sorted order is needed , we can use TreeMap or PriorityQueue.
